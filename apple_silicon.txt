x Survey all code and crash dump archive records
x Work out a porting plan - which are mac examples and need dual flavours
x Examine existing crashes on dtk-machine.local and save them
x Look through my git history to get ideas for tasks I have not yet listed here
x Search internet for Big Sur crashes / crash dumps
x Check pastebin and stackoverflow for Big Sur crashes
x Start a mini-book/diary which is the record of tasks/resources used to update the code
x Update the code, recording what resources were used, hacks and tips in the diary
x Write a summary of the diary with cohesive concepts learned
x Update book production tooling and build the old book
x Research what is needed to do a second edition
x Write a tool that wraps long lines to the limit now needed

x Talk about PAC crashes https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication
x Explain AppVariant:          1:iPhone12,1:13 and AppStoreTools:       11C29
x Explain how when the debugger is attached upon a crash condition, it is possible to make it crash by detaching at the debugger.

t Work through the CDA book updating it
t Should I wait for the first Mac to be released - will I need to buy it to test my code?
t Work out the new art work and back cover text
t Work out what publicity and meta data material is needed for the book
t Publish the new book
t It seems that the latest Apple documentation describes how App Thinning affects App Store crashes.  We need to discuss this in the Symbolification Chapter.
t Talk about Jetsum crashes https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing_issues_using_crash_reports_and_device_logs/identifying_high-memory_use_with_jetsam_event_reports
