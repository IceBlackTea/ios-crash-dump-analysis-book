x Survey all code and crash dump archive records
x Work out a porting plan - which are mac examples and need dual flavours
x Examine existing crashes on dtk-machine.local and save them
x Look through my git history to get ideas for tasks I have not yet listed here
x Search internet for Big Sur crashes / crash dumps
x Check pastebin and stackoverflow for Big Sur crashes
x Start a mini-book/diary which is the record of tasks/resources used to update the code
x Update the code, recording what resources were used, hacks and tips in the diary
x Write a summary of the diary with cohesive concepts learned
x Update book production tooling and build the old book
x Research what is needed to do a second edition
x Write a tool that wraps long lines to the limit now needed
x Work out what KDP tasks are needed to publish a new book
x Consider UIStepper example which fails on macOS via Catalyst
x Consider the analysis https://steipete.com/posts/forbidden-controls-in-catalyst-mac-idiom/ for the mac idiom and missing UI support
x Read the existing CDA book
x Create a list of new chapters and sections needed
x Fix the Bibliography spurious if text
x Fix the zh pdf generation issues; tried a few approaches and may need to leave this one
x Talk about PAC crashes https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication
x Explain AppVariant:          1:iPhone12,1:13 and AppStoreTools:       11C29
x Explain how when the debugger is attached upon a crash condition, it is possible to make it crash by detaching at the debugger.
x Talk about Jetsum crashes https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing_issues_using_crash_reports_and_device_logs/identifying_high-memory_use_with_jetsam_event_reports maybe by writing a share extension https://blog.kulman.sk/dealing-with-memory-limits-in-app-extensions/
x It seems that the latest Apple documentation describes how App Thinning affects App Store crashes.  We need to discuss this in the Symbolification Chapter.  I think I will skip this until I have an app in the store crashing.
x Should I wait for the first Mac to be released - will I need to buy it to test my code?  I need to wait for the Mac to be released to talk about it.
x Jetsam is inevitable so keep background memory use to < 50MB.  Taking a burst of photos can use of a lot of memory.  Use signposts to assist diagnosis.  Implement state restoration.  Describe metric kit.  There is an interesting wrapper library https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Meter/blob/main/Meter/MetricKitWrappers.swift
x Work through the CDA book updating it

x Work out the new art work and back cover text.  Maybe use the black walls newly painted nearby for a new headshot?
x Work out what publicity and meta data material is needed for the book
x Publish the new book
