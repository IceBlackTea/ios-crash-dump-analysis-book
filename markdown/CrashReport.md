# The Crash Report

In this chapter, we get into the details of what comprises a Crash Report.
Our main focus is the iOS Crash Report.  We also cover the macOS Crash Report,
which carries a slightly different structure but serves the same purpose.

Note, it is possible for an app to install crash handlers from third parties, either to get enhanced crash reporting diagnostics, or to link application crashes to a web-based service for managing Crash Reports across a potentially large population of users.  In this chapter we assume the app has not done this, and therefore the Apple CrashReport tool comes into play.

When a crash occurs the `ReportCrash`\index{command!ReportCrash} program extracts information from the crashing process\index{process} from the Operating System.  The result is a text file with a `.crash`\index{extension!.crash} extension.

When symbol information is available, Xcode will symbolicate the Crash Report to show symbolic names instead of machine addresses.  This improves the comprehensibility of the report.

Apple has produced a detailed document explaining the anatomy of a crash dump.  @tn2151

## Guided tour of an iOS Crash Report

Here we go through each section of an iOS Crash Report and explain the fields. @tn2151

tvOS\index{tvOS} and watchOS\index{watchOS} may be just considered subsets of iOS for our purposes and have similar Crash Reports.

Note here we use the term "iOS Crash Report" to mean a Crash Report that came from a physical target device.
After a crash, apps are often debugged on the Simulator.  The exception code may be different in that case because the Simulator uses different methodology to cause the app to stop under the debugger.

### iOS Crash Report Header Section

A Crash Report starts with the following header:

```
Incident Identifier: 692E5696-6994-4FB3-B42D-C9317D956EE7
CrashReporter Key:   1f2cdb7448d354584634e8576c1e5257634fc0cd
Hardware Model:      iPhone12,1
Process:             get [1737]
Path:               
 /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/2BF678BB-7CC6-4CAC-BF
49-0298B611F1BA/get.app/get
Identifier:         
 com.soul.merge.cat.cute.simulator.adventure.get
Version:             44 (1.4.4)
AppStoreTools:       11C29
AppVariant:          1:iPhone12,1:13
Code Type:           ARM-64 (Native)
Role:                Foreground
Parent Process:      launchd [1]
Coalition:          
 com.soul.merge.cat.cute.simulator.adventure.get [757]
```

These items are explained by the following table:

Entry|Meaning
--|--
Incident Identifier|Unique report number of crash
Beta Identifier|Unique identifer scoped to the software author and client device in TestFlight\index{trademark!TestFlight} builds
CrashReporter Key|Unique identifier for the device that crashed
Hardware Model|Apple Hardware Model @ios-devices
Process|Process\index{process} name (number) that crashed
Path|Full pathname of crashing program on the device file system
Identifier|Bundle identifier from `Info.plist`\index{Info.plist}
Version|CFBundleVersion; also CFBundleVersionString in brackets
AppStoreTools|The version of Xcode the app author used to build the app for when _bitcode_ was enabled
AppVariant|The variant of the app produced by _app thinning_ by the App Store before it was deployed to the device
Beta|YES if the crash was TestFlight beta software otherwise absent
Code Type|Target architecture of the process that crashed
Role\index{task!role}|The process `task_role`.  An indicator if we were in the background, foreground, or was a console app.  Mainly affects the scheduling priority of the process.
Parent Process|Parent of the crashing process\index{process}. `launchd`\index{command!launchd} is a process launcher and is often the parent.
Coalition\index{task!coalition}|Tasks are grouped into coalitions so they can pool together their consumption of resources @resource-management

The `AppVariant` field, when present, is explained by _internalVersion_:_nameOfVariantClass_:_osVersionVariant_.

Field|Meaning
--|--
internalVersion|Private field used in the Apple implementation
nameOfVariantClass|Usually a product name or something that characterises a type of hardware device class
osVersionVariant|Variant introduced from a given version of the OS

The first thing to look at is the version.  Typically, if we are a small team or an individual, we will not have the resources to diagnose crashes in older versions of our app, so the first thing might be to get the customer to install the latest version.

If we have many crashes then a pattern may emerge.  It could be one customer (common CrashReporter key seen), or many customers (different CrashReporter keys seen).
This may affect how we rank the priority of the crash.

The hardware model could be interesting.  Is it iPad only devices, or iPhone only, or both?
Maybe our code has less testing or unique code paths for a given platform.
The hardware model might indicate an older device, which we have not tested on.

Whether the app crashed in the Foreground or Background (the Role) is interesting because most applications are not tested whilst they are in the background.  For example, we might receive a phone call, or have task switched between apps.

The Code Type (target architecture) is now mostly 64-bit ARM.  However, we might see ARM being reported - the original 32-bit ARM.

### iOS Crash Report Date and Version Section

A Crash Report will continue with date and version information:

```
Date/Time:           2018-07-16 10:15:31.4746 +0100
Launch Time:         2018-07-16 10:15:31.3763 +0100
OS Version:          iPhone OS 11.3 (15E216)
Baseband Version:    n/a
Report Version:      104
```

These items are explained by the following table:

Entry|Meaning
--|--
Date/Time|When the crash occurred
Launch Time|When the process\index{process} was originally launched before crashing
OS Version| Operating System Version (Build number).  @ios-versions
Release Type| _Beta_ when the OS was Beta software
Baseband Version| Version number of the firmware of the cellular modem (used for phone calls) or `n/a` if the device has no cellular modem (most iPads, iPod Touch, etc.)
Report Version|The version of ReportCrash used to produce the report

The first thing to check is the OS Version.  Is it newer or older than we've tested?  Is it a beta version of the operating system?

The next thing to check is the difference between the launch time and the time of the crash.  Did the app crash immediately or after a long time?  Early start crashes can sometimes be a packaging and deployment problem.  We shall visit some techniques to tackle those later on.

Is the date a sensible value?  Sometimes a device is set back or forwards in time, perhaps to trigger date checks on security certificates or license keys.  Make sure the date is a realistic looking one.

Normally the baseband version is not interesting.  The presence of the baseband means we could be interrupted by a phone call (of course there is VOIP calling as well in any case).  iPad software is generally written to assume we're not going to get a phone call but iPads can be purchased with a cellular modem\index{iPad!cellular modem} option.

### iOS Crash Report Exception Section

A Crash Report will next have exception\index{exception} information:

```
Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)
Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000
Exception Note:  EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY
Triggered by Thread:  0
```

or it may have a more detailed exception information:
```
Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)
Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000
Exception Note:  EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY
Termination Reason: Namespace <0xF>, Code 0xdead10cc
Triggered by Thread:  0
```

What has happened is that the MachOS\index{MachOS} kernel has raised an Operating System Exception on the problematic process\index{process}, which terminates the process.  The ReportCrash program then retrieves from the OS the details of such an exception.

These items are explained by the following table:

Entry|Meaning
--|--
Exception Type|The type of exception in Mach OS. @exception-types
Exception Codes|These codes encode the kind of exception, such as trying to access an invalid address, and supporting information.  @exception-types
Exception Note|Either this says `SIMULATED (this is NOT a crash)` because the process\index{process!killed} was killed by the watchdog timer, or it says `EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY` because the process\index{process!crashed} crashed
Termination Reason|Optionally present, this gives a Namespace (number or subsystem name) and a magic number Code (normally a hex number that looks like a English word).  See below for details on each Termination Code.
Triggered by Thread|The thread in the process\index{process} that caused the crash


In this section, the most important item is the exception type\index{exception!type}.

Exception Type|Meaning
--|--
`EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)` |Our program raised a programming language exception such as a failed assertion and this caused the OS to Abort our app
`EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)` |A process received a quit signal from another process that is managing it.  Typically, this means a Keyboard extension took too long or used up too much memory.  App extensions are given only limited amounts of memory.
`EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)` |The system killed our app (or app extension), usually because some resource limit had been reached.  The Termination Reason needs to be looked at to work out what policy violation was the reason for termination.
`EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)` or `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)` |Our program most likely tried to access a bad memory location or the address was good but we did not have the privilege to access it.  The memory might have been deallocated due to memory pressure.  The pointer to memory we used might have become changed and thus become invalid due to Pointer Authentication\index{Pointer Authentication}\index{PAC}
`EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)` |This is due to an `NSException` being raised (possibly by a library on our behalf) or `_NSLockError` or `objc_exception_throw` being called.  For example, this can be the Swift environment detecting an anomaly such as force unwrapping a nil optional
`EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)` |\index{signal!SIGILL}This is when the program code itself is faulty, not the memory it might be accessing.  This should be rare on iOS devices; perhaps a compiler or optimizer bug, or faulty hand written assembly code.  On Simulator, it is a different story as using an undefined opcode is a technique used by the Swift runtime to stop on access to zombie objects (deallocated objects).  Furthermore, for Apple Silicon Macs running an app in Rosetta\index{trademark!Rosetta} Translation mode, this may suggest an unsupported instruction.
`EXC_GUARD`|This is when the program closed a file descriptor that was guarded.  An example is the SQLite database used by the system.
`EXC_RESOURCE`|This is when the system killed the app because too much of a resource, such as CPU usage, was consumed.  In more recent crash reports, this information is replaced with an Event information section.

When Termination Reason\index{termination reason} is present, we can look up the Code as follows:

Termination Code | Meaning
--|--
`0xdead10cc`\index{0xdead10cc}  |We held a file lock or sqlite database lock before suspending.  We should release locks before suspending.
`0xbaaaaaad`\index{0xbaaaaaad} | A stackshot was done of the entire system via the side and both volume buttons.  See earlier section on System Diagnostics
`0xbad22222`\index{0xbad22222} | VOIP was terminated as it resumed too frequently.  Also seen with code using networking whilst in the background.  If our TCP connection is woken up too many times (say 15 wakes in 300 seconds) we get this crash.
`0x8badf00d`\index{0x8badf00d} | Our app took too long to perform a state change (starting up, shutting down, handling system message, etc.).  The watchdog timer noticed the policy violation and caused the termination.  The most common culprit is doing synchronous networking on the main thread.
`0xc00010ff`\index{0xc00010ff} | The system detected a thermal event and killed off our app.  If it's just on one device it could be a hardware issue, not a software problem in our app.  If it happens on other devices, check our app's power usage using Instruments.
`0x2bad45ec`\index{0x2bad45ec} | There was a security violation. If the Termination Description says, "Process\index{process} detected doing insecure drawing while in secure mode" it means our app tried to write to the screen when it was not allowed because for example the Lock Screen was being shown.

#### Magic Numbers and their Hexspeak

With a certain geek humor, the termination codes, when discussed, are spoken as follows:

Magic Number\index{magic number} | Spoken Phrase
--|--
`0xdead10cc` | Deadlock
`0xbaaaaaad` | Bad
`0xbad22222` | Bad too (two) many times
`0x8badf00d` | Ate (eight) bad food
`0xc00010ff` | Cool Off
`0x2bad45ec` | Too bad for security

#### Aborts
When we have a `SIGABRT`, we should look for what exceptions and assertions are present in our code from the stack trace of the crashed thread.

#### Memory Issues
When we have a memory issue, `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`, with `SIGSEGV` or `SIGBUS`, the faulty memory reference is the second number of the Exception Codes number pair.  For this type of problem, the diagnostics settings within Xcode for the target scheme is relevant.  The address sanitizer should be switched on to see if it could spot the error.

If Xcode shows a lot of memory is being used by the app, then it might be that memory we were relying upon has been freed by the system.  For this, switch on the Malloc Stack logging option, selecting All Allocation and Free History.  Then at some point during the app, the MemGraph button can be clicked, and then the allocation history of objects explored.

For more details, see the Memory Diagnostics Chapter.

#### Exceptions
When we have a `EXC_BREAKPOINT` it can seem confusing.  The program may have been running standalone without a debugger so where did the breakpoint come from?  Typically, we are running `NSException` code.  This will make the system signal the process\index{process} with the trace trap signal and this makes any available debugger attach to the process to aid debugging.  So in the case where we were running the app under the debugger, even with breakpoints switched off, we would breakpoint in here so we can find out why there was a runtime exception.  In the case of normal app running, there is no debugger so we would just crash the app.

#### Illegal Instructions
When we have a `EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION`, the exception codes (second number) will be the problematic assembly code.  This should be a rare condition.  It is worthwhile adjusting the optimization level of the code at fault in the Build Settings because higher level optimizations can cause more exotic instructions to be emitted during build time, and hence a bigger chance for a compiler bug.  Alternatively, the problem might be a lower level library that has hand assembly optimizations in it - such as a multimedia library.  Handwritten assembly can be the cause of bad instructions.

#### Guard exceptions

Certain files descriptors on the system are specially protected because they are used by the Operating System.
When such file descriptors are closed (or otherwise modified) we can get a `EXC_GUARD` exception.

An example is:
```
Exception Type:  EXC_GUARD
Exception Codes: 0x0000000100000000, 0x08fd4dbfade2dead
Crashed Thread:  5
```

The exception code `0x08fd4dbfade2dead`\index{0x08fd4dbfade2dead} indicates a database related file descriptor was modified (in our example it was closed).  The hex string could be read as "Ate (8) File Descriptor (fd) for (4) Database (db)" in "hex speak".

When such problems occur, we look at the file operation\index{file!operation} of the crashed thread.
In our example:
```
Thread 5 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.root.default-priority
Thread 5 Crashed:
0   libsystem_kernel.dylib          0x3a287294 close + 8
1   ExternalAccessory               
0x32951be2 -[EASession dealloc] + 226
```

Here a close\index{file!close} operation was performed.

If we have code talking to file descriptors, we should always check the return value for the close operation in particular.

It is possible to infer the file operation from the first of the exception codes.
It is a 64-bit flag, specified as follows:

Bit Range|Meaning
--|--
63:61|Guard Type where 0x2 means file descriptor
60:32|Flavor
31:00|File descriptor number

From observation, we think the Guard type is not used.

The Flavor is a further bit vector:

Flavor Bit|Meaning
--|--
0|`close()`\index{file!close} attempted
1|`dup()`\index{file!dup}, `dup2()`\index{file!dup2} or `fcntl()`\index{file!fcntl}
2|`sendmsg()`\index{socket!sendmsg} attempted via a socket
4|`write()`\index{file!write} attempted

### iOS Crash Report Filtered Syslog Section

The Crash Report continues with the syslog\index{syslog} section:

```
Filtered syslog:
None found
```

This is an anomalous section because it is supposed to look at the process\index{process!ID} ID of the crashed process and then look to see if there are any syslog \index{command!syslog}(System Log) entries for that process.  We have never seen filtered entries in a crash, and only see `None found` reported.

In later versions of the iOS Crash Report, this section has been removed.

### iOS Crash Report Exception Backtrace section

When our app has detected a problem and has asked the Operating System to terminate the app, we get an Exception Backtrace\index{exception!backtrace} section of the report.  This covers the cases of calling `abort`, `NSException`,  `_NSLockError`, or `objc_exception_throw` either ourselves or indirectly through the Swift, Objective-C or C runtime support libraries.

What we don't get is the text of the actual assertion that had occurred.  One presumes that the prior section for filtered syslog information was supposed to do that job.  Nevertheless, _Window->Devices and Simulators->Open Console_ will allow us to recover that information.

When we see an Exception Backtrace in a customer Crash Report, we should ask for the device console log of the crashing device.

We would for example see:
```

The line of interest is:
```
'-[__NSCFConstantString _isDispatchData]:
unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3f054'
```

This means the `NSString` class was sent the `_isDispatchData` method.
No such method exists.

The format of this backtrace is the same as the thread backtrace, described later.

The purpose of the exception back trace section is to give more detail than that provided by the crashing thread.

The crashing thread in the above scenario had the thread backtrace:

```

If we only had the thread backtrace, we would know there was a casting problem `__cxa_bad_cast` but not much more.

A little bit of Internet searching reveals that `NSData` has a private helper class `_NSPlaceholderData`

What has happened here is that an `NSString` object was provided where an `NSData` object was expected.

### iOS Crash Report Thread Section

The Crash Report continues with a dump of the thread backtraces as follows (formatted for ease of demonstration)

The Crash Report will explicitly tell us which thread crashed.
```
Thread 0 Crashed:
```

Threads are numbered\index{thread!number}, and if they have a name, we are told this:
```
Thread 0 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread
```

Most of our focus should be on the crashed thread; it is often thread 0.
Take note of the thread name\index{thread!name}.  Note no long duration tasks such as networking
may be done on the main thread\index{thread!main}, `com.apple.main-thread`, because that thread
is used to handle user interactions.

The references to `__workq_kernreturn`\index{thread!waiting for work} just indicate a thread waiting for work
so can be ignored unless there are a huge number of them.

Similarly, the references to `mach_msg_trap`\index{thread!waiting for message} just indicate the thread is waiting for a message to come in.

When looking at stack backtraces, stack frame 0, the top of the stack, comes first, and then calling frames are listed.
Therefore, the last thing being done is in frame 0.  

#### Stack backtrace items

Let us now focus on backtrace items for each thread.  For example:
```
20  UIKit                         	0x000000018db14c88
-[_UICanvasLifecycleSettingsDiffAction
performActionsForCanvas:
withUpdatedScene:settingsDiff:fromSettings:
transitionContext:] + 248
```

Column | Meaning
--|--
1 | Stack frame number, with 0 the most recently executed.
2 | Binary file executing.
3 | Execution position (frame 0), or return position (frame 1 onwards)
4+ | Symbolic function name or address with offset within the function

The frame numbers\index{stack!frame number}, as they count upwards takes us backwards in time in terms of program execution order.  The top of stack, or most recently run code, is in frame 0.  One reason for writing code with meaningful function names is that the call stack describes what is going on conceptually.  Using small single-purpose functions\index{software!function}\index{function!best practice} is good practice.  It serves the needs of both diagnostics and maintainability.

The second column in a back trace is the binary file\index{file!binary}.  We focus on our own binary mostly because framework code from Apple is generally very reliable.  Faults usually occur either directly in our code, or by faults caused by incorrect usage of Apple APIs.
Just because the code crashed in Apple provided code does not mean the fault is in Apple code.

The third column, the execution position\index{CPU!execution position}, is slightly tricky.  If it is for frame 0, it is the actual position in the code that was running.  If it is for any later frame, it is the position in the code we shall resume from once the child functions have returned.

The fourth column is the site at which the code is running (for frame 0), or the site\index{function!call site} that is making a function call (for later frames).  For symbolicated crashes, we will see the symbolic form for the address.  This will include a positional offset from the start of a function to reach the code calling the child function.  If we have only short functions, this offset will be a small value.  It means much less stepping through code, or much less reading assembly code when performing diagnosis.  That is another reason for keeping our functions short.  If our crash is not symbolicated then we shall just see a memory address\index{CPU!memory address} value.

Therefore, with the example stack frame we have:

- Stack Frame 20.
- UIKit Binary File.
- `0x000000018db14c88` return address after frames 0 - 19 return.
- Call site is 248 bytes from the beginning of method  
  `performActionsForCanvas`
- Class is `_UICanvasLifecycleSettingsDiffAction`

### iOS Crash Report Thread State Section

iOS Crash Reports will be either from ARM-64 binaries\index{CPU!ARM-64} (most common) or legacy ARM 32\index{CPU!ARM-32} bit binaries.

In each case, we get similar looking information describing the state of the ARM registers\index{CPU!register}.

One thing to look out for is the special hex code, `0xbaddc0dedeadbead`\index{0xbaddc0dedeadbead} which means a non-initialized pointer.However, newer versions of the Swift runtime don't make use of this.

Here we see that for a ARM64 crash, we no longer get `0xbaddc0dedeadbead`\index{0xbaddc0dedeadbead} set in `x11`.  Instead, we get a new entry `esr:`.  This means "Exception Syndrome Register"\index{CPU!Exception Syndrome Register}.  @ARMv8_ESR.

Bit Range|Meaning | Mnemonic
--|--
31:26|Exception Class|ESR_ELx.EC
25|Instruction Length|ESR_ELx.IL
15:0|Comment|ESR_ELx.ISS

In this instance bits `[31:26]` value `0b111100` means a `BRK` instruction was executed.  Bit `25` whose value is `1` means in our case a `A64` `BRK` instruction was supplied.  The bottom bits `[15:0]` value `1` means `1` when supplied when `BRK` was invoked. @ARM_BRK

### iOS Crash Report Binary Images section

The Crash Report has a section enumerating all the binary\index{file!binary} images loaded by the process that crashed.
It is usually a long list.  It highlights the fact that there are many supporting frameworks for our apps.
Most frameworks are private frameworks\index{software!private framework}.  The iOS development kit might seem a huge set of APIs, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Here is an example list, edited for ease of demonstration:

```

The first part is where the image has been loaded into memory.
Here `icdab_as` has been loaded into the range `0x104018000` - `0x10401ffff`

The second part is the name of the binary.  Here it is `icdab_as`.

The third part is the architecture slice within the binary that was loaded.
We generally expect to just see `arm64` here (ARM 64-bit).

The fourth part is the UUID\index{file!UUID} of the binary.
Here `icdab_as` has UUID `b82579f401603481990d1c1c9a42b773`

Symbolification will fail if our DSYM file UUID does not match the binary.

Here is an example of corresponding UUIDs seen in DSYM and application binaries using the `dwarfdump`\index{command!dwarfdump} command:

```
$ dwarfdump --uuid icdab_as.app/icdab_as
icdab_as.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/icdab_as

UUID: 25BCB4EC-21DE-3CE6-97A8-B759F31501B7
 (arm64) icdab_as.app/icdab_as

UUID: 25BCB4EC-21DE-3CE6-97A8-B759F31501B7
 (arm64)
icdab_as.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/icdab_as
```

The fifth part is the path to the binary as it appears on the device.

Most of the binaries have a self-explanatory name.  The `dyld` binary is the dynamic loader\index{file!dynamic loader}.
It is seen at the bottom of all stack backtraces because it is responsible for commencing the loading of binaries before their execution.

The dynamic loader does many tasks in preparing our binary for execution.  If our binary references libraries, it will load them.  If there are absent, it will fail to load our app.  This is why it is possible to crash even before any code in `main.m` is called.  Later on, we shall study how to diagnose such problems.


## Guided tour of a macOS Crash Report

The macOS Crash Report is similar to an iOS Crash Report even though macOS CrashReport and iOS CrashReport are distinctly different programs.  To avoid repetition, we just highlight notable differences from iOS.

Traditionally Mac computers only used the Intel\index{trademark!Intel} CPU but that has changed with the introduction of Apple Silicon.  So we can now see both ARM-64\index{CPU!ARM-64} and X86-64\index{CPU!X86-64} crashes on Mac hardware.  
A number of subtle issues can arise because Apple Silicon Macs can translate X86-64 instructions as well as running native ARM-64 binaries.  Therefore we shall focus on Intel X86-64 crashes in this chapter, and leave Apple Silicon Mac crashes to their own chapter.

### macOS Crash Report Header Section

The crash dump starts with the header:

```
Process:               SiriNCService [1045]
Path:                  /System/Library/CoreServices/Siri.app/
Contents/XPCServices/SiriNCService.xpc/
Contents/MacOS/SiriNCService
Identifier:            com.apple.SiriNCService
Version:               146.4.5.1 (146.4.5.1)
Build Info:            AssistantUIX-146004005001000~1
Code Type:             X86-64 (Native)
Parent Process:        ??? [1]
Responsible:           Siri [863]
User ID:               501
```

Here we see familiar information describing the binary at fault.
The process that crashed was SiriNCService, and the process responsible for that was Siri.
There was a cross process communication\index{software!cross process communication} at the time of the crash (XPC) between Siri\index{trademark!Siri} and SiriNCService.

Whilst iOS is a system that runs the user experience as one user, the macOS system exposes the fact that there are multiple User IDs\index{User ID} in the system.

### macOS Crash Report Date and Version Section

We continue with version information:

```
Date/Time:             2018-06-24 09:52:01.419 +0100
OS Version:            Mac OS X 10.13.5 (17F77)
Report Version:        12
Anonymous UUID:        00CC683B-425F-ABF0-515A-3ED73BACDDB5

Sleep/Wake UUID:       10AE8838-17A9-4405-B03D-B680DDC84436

```

The Anonymous UUID\index{computer!anonymous UUID} will uniquely identify the computer.  The Sleep/Wake UUID is used to match up sleep and wake events.  Failed wakeup is a common cause of a system crash (in contrast to the application crashes we have been discussing).  Further information can be obtained using the `pmset`\index{command!pmset} power management\index{computer!power management} command.

### macOS Duration Section  

The macOS Crash Report shows how soon the application crash occurred.
```
Time Awake Since Boot: 100000 seconds
Time Since Wake:       2000 seconds
```

We use this as a broad indication only because the numbers seen always rounded to a convenient number.

### macOS Crash Report System Integrity Section

```
System Integrity Protection: enabled
```

Modern macOS by default runs as "rootless"\index{computer!rootless}.  This means that even if we are logged in as the superuser we cannot change system binaries.  Those are protected with the help of firmware.  It is possible to boot macOS with System Integrity Protection\index{computer!System Integrity Protection} disabled.  If we only get crashes where SIP is disabled, then we need to ask why SIP is off and what changes were made to the Operating System.

### macOS Crash Report Exception Section

We next get an exceptions section.

```
Crashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread

Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000018
Exception Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY

Termination Signal:    Segmentation fault: 11
Termination Reason:    Namespace SIGNAL, Code 0xb
Terminating Process:   exc handler [0]

VM Regions Near 0x18:

    __TEXT                 0000000100238000-0000000100247000

     Contents/XPCServices/SiriNCService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/
     SiriNCService

Application Specific Information:
objc_msgSend() selector name: didUnlockScreen:
```

This is similar to iOS.  However, we should note that if we are reproducing an iOS crash on the simulator, then the simulator might model the same programming error differently.  We can get a different exception\index{exception} on x86 hardware than its ARM counterpart.

Consider the following code, setup with legacy manual reference counting (MRC)\index{Objective-C!manual reference counting} instead of automatic reference counting\index{Objective-C!automatic reference counting} (ARC)

```
void use_sema() {
    dispatch_semaphore_t aSemaphore =
     dispatch_semaphore_create(1);
    dispatch_semaphore_wait(aSemaphore, DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER);
    dispatch_release(aSemaphore);
}
```

This code causes a crash because a semaphore\index{semaphore} was manually released whilst we were waiting on it.

When it runs on iOS on ARM hardware we get the crash,
```
Exception Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)
Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000001, 0x00000001814076b8
Termination Signal: Trace/BPT trap: 5
Termination Reason: Namespace SIGNAL, Code 0x5
Terminating Process: exc handler [0]
Triggered by Thread:  0

Application Specific Information:
BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: Semaphore object deallocated while
 in use
 Abort Cause 1
```

When it runs on the iOS simulator, we get the debugger attaching with
```
Thread 1: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0)
```

The simulator uses a bad assembly\index{CPU!bad assembly instruction} instruction to trigger the crash.

Furthermore, if we write a macOS app that runs the same code, we get the crash\index{signal!SIGILL}:

```
Crashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread

Exception Type:        EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)
Exception Codes:       0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000000000000
Exception Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY

Termination Signal:    Illegal instruction: 4
Termination Reason:    Namespace SIGNAL, Code 0x4
Terminating Process:   exc handler [0]

Application Specific Information:
BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH:
Semaphore object deallocated while in use
```

The take away message is when iOS ARM crashes are being reproduced on x86 hardware, either via the Simulator or via equivalent macOS code, expect the runtime environment to be different and cause a slightly different looking crash.

Fortunately, here it is clear that a semaphore was deallocated whilst it was in use in both Crash Reports.

### macOS Crash Report Thread Section

We next have the thread section.  This is similar to iOS.

Here is an example thread in a macOS Crash Report:

```

### macOS Crash Report Thread State Section

The macOS Crash Report shows details of the X86 registers\index{CPU!X86 register} in the crashed thread.

```
Thread 0 crashed with X86 Thread State (64-bit):
  rax: 0x0000600000249bd0  rbx: 0x0000600000869ac0

Logical CPU:     2
Error Code:      0x00000004
Trap Number:     14
```

In addition to the iOS equivalent, we get further information about the CPU that was running the thread.  The trap\index{operating system!trap number} number can be looked up in the Darwin XNU source code if needed.

A convenient mirror of the Darwin XNU source code is hosted by GitHub:
https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu

The traps can be searched for.  Here we have `osfmk/x86_64/idt_table.h` indicating Trap 14 is a page fault.  The Error Code is a bit vector, used to describe the mach error code.  @macherror

### macOS Crash Report Binary Images section

Next, we have the binary images loaded by the crashing app.

Here is an example of the first few binaries in a Crash Report, truncated for ease of demonstration:

```
Binary Images:
       0x100238000 -        0x1ß00246fff
         com.apple.SiriNCService (146.4.5.1 - 146.4.5.1)
          <5730AE18-4DF0-3D47-B4F7-EAA84456A9F7>
           /System/Library/CoreServices/Siri.app/Contents/
           XPCServices/SiriNCService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/
           SiriNCService

       0x101106000 -        0x10110affb
         com.apple.audio.AppleHDAHALPlugIn (281.52 - 281.52)
          <23C7DDE6-A44B-3BE4-B47C-EB3045B267D9>
           /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext/Contents/
           PlugIns/AppleHDAHALPlugIn.bundle/Contents/MacOS/
           AppleHDAHALPlugIn
```

When a plus sign appears next to the binary it is meant to mean the binary is part of the OS\index{file!operating system}.  However, we see examples of the plus sign present in third party binaries and absent in system binaries, so the plus sign is not a reliable indicator (last tested on OS X 10.13.6).  

### macOS Crash Report Modification Summary

Next, we have a section describing any external modifications\index{crash!process integrity} to our crashed process:

```
External Modification Summary:
  Calls made by other processes targeting this process:
    task_for_pid: 184
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 0
  Calls made by this process:
    task_for_pid: 0
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 0
  Calls made by all processes on this machine:
    task_for_pid: 72970
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 0
```

macOS is a more open platform than iOS.  This permits under certain conditions modification of our process.  We need to know if such a thing happened because it can invalidate any design assumption in the code because registers can be modified of the process and thus a crash can be induced.

Ordinarily the above snapshot would be seen.  Notably `thread_set_state`\index{thread!set state} is zero in all cases.  This means no process has directly attached to the process\index{process!attachment} to change the state of a register.  Such actions would be acceptable for implementations of managed runtimes, or debuggers.  Outside of these scenarios, such actions would be suspicious and need further investigation.

In the following example, we see that the thread state had been changed by an external process on one occasion, in addition to 200 `task_for_pid`\index{task!for pid} calls.

```
External Modification Summary:
  Calls made by other processes targeting this process:
    task_for_pid: 201
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 1
  Calls made by this process:
    task_for_pid: 0
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 0
  Calls made by all processes on this machine:
    task_for_pid: 6184
    thread_create: 0
    thread_set_state: 1
```

Such data would normally make us suspicious of the environment the program ran in, before crashing.

Ordinarily only first party (Apple provided) programs have privilege to perform the above modifications.  It is possible to install software that also does this.

The requirements for accessing process\index{process!modification requirements} modification APIs are:

- System Integrity Protection\index{operating system!System Integrity Protection} needs to be disabled.
- The process making the modification must run as root.
- The program making the modifications must be code signed\index{software!code signing}.
- The entitlement assigned to the program must have `SecTaskAccess` set to  `allowed` and `debug`
- The user must agree to trust the program in their security settings.

The example code `tfpexample` demonstrates this.  @icdabgithub

### macOS Crash Report Virtual Memory Section

The next section of the Crash Report is the virtual memory\index{memory!virtual} summary and region type breakdown.
If we have a graphics heavy app that renders pages of a document, we might look at how big the CoreUI image data region is, for example.  Virtual memory statistics are only meaningful when the app has already been studied in the Xcode Instruments\index{trademark!Xcode Instruments} memory profiler\index{test!memory profiling} because then we can get a feel for the dynamic usage of memory in the app, and thus begin to spot when things look numerically wrong.

Here is an example of the VM Region Section of the report:

```
VM Region Summary:
ReadOnly portion of Libraries: Total=544.2M resident=0K(0%)
swapped_out_or_unallocated=544.2M(100%)

Sometimes our app closely interacts with a hardware peripheral, and if that is via a standards based interface such as USB\index{hardware!USB}, then a lot of variability is possible.  Consider disk drives.  Many vendors provide disk drives, and they may be directly powered, or independently powered.  They may be directly attached, attached via a USB cable, or via a USB hub.

Sometimes newer hardware, such as a new type of MacBook Pro\index{trademark!MacBook Pro} comes with its own hardware issues, so crashes unrelated to our app can be seen.

The key to understanding whether the hardware environment\index{hardware!environment} comes into play is to see a number of crashes to look for patterns.

As application developers, we only see crashes in our app.  If we have contact with the user who has provided a crash, we can ask if any other apps are crashing, or if any system stability\index{hardware!stability} issues are present.

Another interesting aspect is that not all hardware is actively used by the system all the time.  For example, when a MacBook Pro is connected to an external display\index{hardware!external display}, different graphics RAM\index{memory!graphics RAM} is used and a different graphics card\index{hardware!graphics card} is used (external versus an internal GPU).
If our app does something special, when connected to an external display, the fault may be in the hardware instead of our code due to it triggering a latent fault in the hardware.

Running system diagnostics\index{hardware!diagnostics} and looking to see if the problems are appearing against only specific Anonymous UUID\index{computer!anonymous UUID} Crash Reports are ways to try and understand if we have a machine specific hardware issue.
