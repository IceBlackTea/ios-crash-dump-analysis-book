It has been a mere two years, but the pace of development of Apple Technologies is as fast as ever.

My professional journey has been most interesting during this period, as I was hired as a contractor (known as a vendor-on-site contractor) for Apple.  Like many engineers before me, I was firmly of the opinion that getting through the hiring process was some kind of fluke, or mistake.  Holding the Apple badge in my hand, it felt like it was a magical key; so clean, perfectly formed, and succinct, as any Apple product.  As a matter of fact, I never worked on the secret stuff at Apple, but other people did.  There was a running joke, however.  "Have you found the secret room?" one engineer would ask the new hires.  I puzzled about it during the first couple of weeks, and then found it hiding in plain sight!  A cavern.  At Apple, it was more a matter of being a master of the public APIs in your focus area, and working with other engineers to solve problems in those areas (my area was Accessibility).  An intense, but interesting, two years.

This second edition of the book was prompted by a long-speculated addition to the Apple product line-up, Apple Silicon Macs.

I've updated the text, and modernized the examples, to reflect the latest OS versions and SDKs.  As of the time of writing, these are iOS 12.2\index{iOS!14.2}, macOS 11.0 Big Sur\index{macOS!Big Sur}\index{macOS!11.0}, and Xcode 12.2\index{Xcode!12.2}. 

It seems to me the direction of travel of Apple Products is towards Apple Silicon chips, which utilise the ARM\index{trademark!ARM} ABI\index{ABI}, and the advanced features that come with recent versions of this architecture.  To this end, I have introduced chapters on translation mode crashes on Apple Silicon, and Pointer Authentication crashes.
