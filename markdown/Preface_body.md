This book grew from an inspiration gained back in the late 1990s.

It's hard to overstate the euphoria of the moment.  The Internet was the next Industrial Revolution.  Investors saw it as the best place to put their money.  Hardware, software and services were all experiencing a Cambrian explosion of diversity and innovation.

I found myself at the center of things.  I was newly recruited to Sun Microsystems.  At that time, if you had a great idea for a website and wanted to start serving your customers, Sun Microsystems computers were an essential purchase.  These were servers that you would either house yourself or place with a co-location provider.

Computer technology was already well developed by then, but existing solutions were now being put to use in new scenarios, and at Internet-scale.  What was a perfectly good implementation of Unix, SunOS, from the rarefied halls of Stanford University was now running on E-Bay and had to be up and running without a glitch.

We had an electronic board showing the status of our critical customers.  Saudi Aramco was permanently lit in red to such an extent that we wondered if that was a fault on the board itself.

My first day was somewhat ignominious.  I wasn't even given my own cubicle.  My desk looked like a school table.  My keyboard had several faulty and inoperative keys.  I sat in one corner of a vast cube-farm and actually forgot which corner it was at on the first day.  After lunch, I returned to my desk after an extensive walk around the other corners.

One thing struck me was that there was a book sitting on the desk of about a quarter of the 500 odd engineers.  It proudly said on the front cover, "Panic!" @panicbook.  It was a book on SunOS crash dump analysis.

After acquiring a proper cubicle and getting to know my colleagues, I noticed that the engineers with the "Panic!" book just seemed to have that extra edge in handling low-level issues reported by Customers.  Collectively it lifted the problem solving IQ of the Answer Center where I worked.

At Sun, there was a deep culture of learning.  We were given such extensive training, and support, it was often the case we'd be doing seven courses per year - each a week long.

All was good until one course came up.  It was called Analytical Troubleshooting (ATS).  This caused great controversy within the Answer Center.  It was a formal methodology for solving problems.
It could not tell you the answers, but it would ensure you were forced to ask the right questions.  It turned out that on our hardest problems, we were missing asking the right questions.

This was a major step improvement in productivity.  Nevertheless, some engineers, quite out of character, were loudly critical.  It turned out that these techniques were just things experienced engineers had learnt as part of their craft and they didn't want the magic to be laid bare for anyone to pick up cheaply.

One day Chris Drake was in town and popped into our office.  He was the x86 architecture specialist that collaborated with Kimberley Brown to produce the "Panic!" book.  They arranged a workshop to educate us on SunOS crashes on x86 architecture.  It was something of a novelty at the time, prior to the remarkable rise of Linux and the GNU/Linux system.

I remember one time, as an undergraduate student, during an Operating Systems lecture, I looked across the room.  I noticed it was full of Sun Microsystems equipment;  I stared into the Sun logo and dreamed of one day working there.  It came true.  So in my workshop on x86 panics, I had another idea.  One day I would write a book.  It would be something quite focussed on a single technical problem.  It would be something that would convey the experiences I had obtained in my career.  It turns out that came true, as well, in the book you are reading now!
